# NPAT 2017
My solutions to the National Programming Aptitude Test 2017 conducted by NPTEL. The repo consists of code in Java and C for questions no. 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8, namely:

* Does an integer appear k times in first n positions of an array
* Largest sum of m consecutive elements
* Additive sequence of an array
* Printing 2n lines in reverse sequence
* Most frequent 3 integers

I'm hoping to add Python translations for these solutions soon.
